# Podcast catcher webapp

https://pods.netlify.app/

## Description
This is my version of a podcast rss feed catcher. This app will allow you to either manually add rss feeds, or search for a podcast feed (via the itunes api) and add podcasts that way. Added podcast shows will then be displayed on the home tab, you can then navigate through to the show episodes, view the episode notes, and play episodes.

The app features a player which will continue to play an episode even while browsing through the app or minimising the web browser. The app will remember your added shows when you return to the app via browser local storage.

## Technology stack
This app is built with the svelte framework, netlify functions, itunes search api, javascript, css, and html.
